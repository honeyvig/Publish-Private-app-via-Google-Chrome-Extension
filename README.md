# Publish-Private-app-via-Google-Chrome-Extension
To publish a private app via a Google Chrome extension, you can distribute it without making it
publicly available on the Chrome Web Store. This is often done for internal or enterprise use
cases where only specific users or organizations need access to the app. Here's how you can
publish a private app through a Chrome extension:
1. Prepare Your Chrome Extension
Before you distribute your extension, make sure it is fully developed, tested, and ready for
deployment. Your extension should include:
● Manifest file (manifest.json): This file contains metadata about your extension, like
its name, version, permissions, and background scripts.
● Code and Assets: Your extension’s JavaScript, HTML, CSS, images, etc., should be
packaged into a folder.
2. Distribute Privately Using the Chrome Web Store (Unlisted or Private)
There are two main ways to distribute a Chrome extension privately using the Chrome Web
Store:
A. Publish as an Unlisted Extension
This method allows you to publish the extension on the Chrome Web Store without making it
publicly discoverable. Only users with the direct URL to the extension can install it.
1. Create a Developer Account:
○ Visit the Google Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
○ If you haven't already, you'll need to pay a one-time registration fee of $5 to set
up a developer account.
2. Upload the Extension:
○ On the Developer Dashboard, click on the "Add a new item" button.
○ Upload a ZIP file containing your extension's code and assets (the folder
containing manifest.json and other necessary files).
3. Configure the Extension:
○ Fill in details like the name, description, and category for your extension.
○ Select “Unlisted” under the visibility section (this ensures that the extension won’t
be publicly searchable).
4. Publish the Extension:
○ Once you've completed the necessary details, click on the "Publish" button.
○ After publishing, you will be provided with a direct URL to your extension (e.g.,
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/your-extension-id).
5. Share the URL:
○ Share the URL with your intended users (e.g., colleagues or clients) to install the
extension.
